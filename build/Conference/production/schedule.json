As Rubyists and software engineers, its important for us to know what tools related to NLP are available to us and how we can make use of them most effectively.\n<br/><br/>While there are a number of really great open-source libraries for natural language processing in Ruby and many great strides have been made in recent years, thereâ€™s still often a need to leverage tools and libraries externally from the Ruby ecosystem. Some of the best open-source NLP frameworks available rely very heavily on contributions from the academic world where Ruby as a language doesnâ€™t have the same presence as other languages like Python or Java.</p><p>In this talk, Iâ€™ll provide a beginner friendly introduction to NLP in general and Iâ€™ll give a quick overview of the tools and related projects that are currently available in the Ruby community. In addition, using real-world examples Iâ€™ll demonstrate how to painlessly leverage high performance, mature and well-established NLP libraries directly from your Ruby application using JRuby and JDK 7.</p>",

I will also review some uncommon NoSQL databases that address common use cases, and suggest that perhaps some of these should be used more often. Most importantly, I will describe the different state of mind that you should have when building applications on top of these NoSQL options, and provide visualization of non-relational concerns like: fault tolerance, availability, consistency, capacity planning, and horizontal vs vertical scaling.

If you go overboard in the beginning, you're doing extra work and getting some of it wrong. If you wait too long, you've got a mess.</p><p>At Yammer, we constantly clean up the mess that worked well in the early days, but has become troublesome to maintain and scale. We pull things out of the core Rails app, stand them up on their own, and make sure they work well and are fast.  With 20+ services, we've learned some lessons along the way. Services that seem clean in the beginning can turn into development environment nightmares. Temporary double-dispatching solutions turn into developer confusion. Monitoring one app turns into monitoring a suite of apps and handling failure between them.</p><p>This talk looks at our mistakes and solutions, the tradeoffs, and how we're able to keep moving quickly.  Having services and a smaller Rails codebase makes for scalable development teams, happier engineers, and predictable production environments.

    "description": "<p>Underneath the beautiful veneer of our Ruby libraries lies a twisted tangle of writhing guts. Maybe you're curious how the pieces fit together or maybe you're tracking down a bug, either way it's easy to get lost in the blood and bile that ties our code together. In this talk you'll learn how to use simple and sharp Ruby tools to slice into large libraries with surgical precision. We'll do some live hacking on Rails on the stage and cover useful code probing techniques. Turn your impossible bugs into pull requests, and level up your programming skills by Dissecting Ruby with Ruby.\n</p>",

    "description": "<p>Coming from a hacker background, Iâ€™ve continually been surprised by how frequently new grads lacked the skills needed, particularly in community learning. When I was asked to teach Ruby on Rails at Columbia University I observed that a significant number of the skills required to become successful professionals in the industry are acquired on the job and arenâ€™t being taught in school. </p><p>This presentation will review:\n<br/>    - Lessons learned from the experience teaching in my alma materâ€™s CS program. \n<br/>    - How I developed a hacker-centric curriculum teaching not only the algorithms, but the keys to being a successful developer in the modern open source driven Rails community. \n<br/>    - How we as hackers can fix this.</p>",
